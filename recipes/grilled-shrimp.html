		<h2>Grilled Shrimp Skewers</h2>
		<p>These delicious shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or parties.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<h4>Sauce</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1/3 cup water</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
			<li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
			<li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 Â½-inch pieces</li>
			<li>skewers</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
				until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
			<li>
				Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides
				of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Recipe Tips</h3>
		<p>Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.</p>
		<p>I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), but use what you have on hand.</p>
		<p>If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</p>
		<p>Prep the homemade sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner.</p>
